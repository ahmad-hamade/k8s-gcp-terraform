What is your favorite feature that GCP or its competitor has recently brought to market, and how are you intending to use it?

Since I'm using AWS along with Kubernetes, I was happy to see the clean integration between AWS AppMesh and Istio along with EKS.
The second cool feature that got introduced recently is to use EKS with managed nodes instead of having a custom AMI for running K8s nodes.

What future or current technology do you look forward to the most or want to use and why?
Kubernetes and service mesh.

Since I used to work as a developer, I deeply understand how important are these 2 stacks and how it can help the business in terms of releasing fast and with running multi versioned app in a single cluster along with other cool features with security, monitoring, and circuit breaker.
